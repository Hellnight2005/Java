# Operators in Java

This Markdown file explains operators in Java programming language.

## Introduction

Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands.
In Java, operators can be categorized into several types, such as arithmetic operators, assignment operators, relational operators, logical operators, etc. 
This document provides a brief explanation of each type of operator in Java.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on numerical operands. 
They include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

- **Addition (+)**: Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (/)**: Divides the first operand by the second.
- **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. 
They include simple assignment (`=`) as well as compound assignment operators such as `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.

## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values.
They return a boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false.
They include equality (`==`), inequality (`!=`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), and less than or equal to (`<=`).

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean operands.
They include AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`). 
They are often used in conditional statements and loops.

## Increment and Decrement Operators

Increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1, respectively.

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integer operands at the bit level.
They include AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), left shift (`<<`), right shift (`>>`), and unsigned right shift (`>>>`).


## Conclusion

Operators are fundamental building blocks of Java programming, allowing developers to perform various operations on operands. 
Understanding the different types of operators and their usage is essential for writing efficient and expressive Java code.
